Welcome to the Enum Tutorial!
Prerequesites: Classes and Structs

With the "bool" data type, we can set a variable to "true" or "false".
There are two states in a boolean, and only two states.
However, we might want a variable that holds more than two states.

For example, when you are playing a game, there are many states of the game:
cutscene, loading, gameplay, menus, etc.

A character in a game can be in hundreds of different states,
talking, walking, dying, running, fighting, or just standing still.

In this tutorial, we show how to use "enum" which allows a programmer
to set a series of states, and shows how to apply them.
